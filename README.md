# ShopNav

The ShopNav website is a simple interactive map application built using HTML, CSS, and the Leaflet library. This application allows users to locate and explore various shops across a geographic area. Users can view a list of shops on the left side of the screen, click on a shop's name to fly to its location on the map, and view additional details about each shop in a popup.
